            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Upon this Score it is I become an Adviſer to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee their Indiſcreet Zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> is like to betray them into ſuch Practices, as ſuit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Wilds of <hi>Africa</hi> and Unbelieving <hi>Turks,</hi> than with Thoſe, who glory that they are born in a Chriſtian Soil, and bred up in the moſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate

and beſt Temper'd Religion in the World. For I appeal now to any Chriſtian, whoſe Soul is not wholly feer'd and ſtupified, whether That <hi>Shew,</hi> which on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, <hi>March</hi> 17. was led through the Principal Streets of this <hi>Proteſtant</hi> City, <hi>viz. Bears</hi> with <hi>Croſſes</hi> in their Foreheads, a <hi>Bull</hi> with a <hi>Croſs</hi> on each Horn, a <hi>Maſtiff-Dog</hi> with a <hi>Croſs</hi> in his Forehead, was not a <hi>Mockery</hi> of Heaven; and a moſt prophane Ridiculing of the Chief <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion? And yet ſuch was the Paſtime of this City, while paſſing through ſo many Streets, that Sacred <hi>Sign</hi> of Mans Redemption was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the ſcornful Smiles of the Ignorant Crowds, and met with None, as I can hear of, that had Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion enough to diſturb the Prophanation.</p>
            <p>If this had been acted in a City peopled with <hi>Jews, Infidels</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> it had been only agreeable to their Principles, and would neither have call'd for <hi>Advice</hi> or <hi>Wonder</hi> from any Chriſtian Beholder; but that this ſhould be done in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> City, and in the middle of <hi>ſuch Chriſtians</hi> too, who pretend to take up nothing of Chriſtianity, but ſuch as is <hi>Reform'd, Pure</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncorrupt,</hi> 'tis matter of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and if it ſhould paſs without Cenſure or Reproof, 'twould be a juſt entit'ling thoſe Beaſts that wore the <hi>Croſs</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> of the Town, and give occaſion to Forreigners to think, that the Title of Beaſt did not belong ſo much to <hi>thoſe</hi> that bore the <hi>Croſſes,</hi> as to the <hi>Lookers on</hi> and Permitters, and much more to the Promoters and Applauders of it. I muſt make bold therefore to tell you, My <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that this ſort of <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> is not at all becoming; and that 'tis ſomething to be fear'd,

that while ſome <hi>Hot Spirits</hi> are teaching their Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to hate <hi>Popery,</hi> they'l put 'em upon over doing the work, and oblige 'em to be <hi>No Chriſtians</hi> whilſt they are teaching them to be <hi>No Papiſts.</hi> throught we had enough of this kind of <hi>Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> when <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> with <hi>Others</hi> that made <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Their Divinity,</hi> taught people to be <hi>Batba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> and <hi>Mad</hi> for Conſcience ſake; when Sir <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller</hi> joinng <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> all in one, Burnt <hi>Crucifixes</hi> and <hi>Croſſes</hi> for the promoting <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> But it ſeems, tho' theſe be out of the way, their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is yet behind, 'tis kept alive, 'tis encourag'd, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; They that can expoſe the Croſs to Contempt upon the Foreheads and Horns of Beaſts, no doubt are diſpos'd enough, were the time come, to cloſe this triumph by committing it to the Flames. O how unlike this is to the ſpirit of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whoſe Religion you pretend to follow. You ſay, you are of the Religion of <hi>Conſtantine, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtin,</hi> &amp;c. But do you think thoſe Holy Fathers could have ſeen, heard, or paſs'd by ſuch an impious mocking as this, without juſt indignation and a zealous reproof? <hi>Conſtantine</hi> honour'd the Croſs, and laid it up for the preſervation of his Regal City: <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> tells us, that Kings have a Croſs on their Robes, a Croſs on their Crowns, a Croſs at their Prayers, a Croſs upon their Arms, a Croſs upon the Altar; and that a Princes Head is more honour'd with a Croſs than with a Crown. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declares, That the Croſs is made honourable now amongſt Chriſtians, and an end put to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but not to its Glory: From Places of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, 'tis now tranſlated, ſays he, to the Foreheads

of Emperors: But now how unlike are you to theſe Ancient Fathers, whilſt having torn the Croſs from the Altar, you ſet it out to ſcorn upon the <hi>Horns</hi> of Beaſts, and from the Foreheads of Kings and Chriſtians, and even from your own too in Baptiſm, you moſt prophanely tranſlate it to that of <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Dogs,</hi> as if it were they who are to fight under the Standard of Chriſt. Is this the Religion of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times? Is this according to the Purity of the Goſpel? This kind of ſpirit was too Active indeed in the time of the Reformation, but ſure the world has had enough of it; there's no need now of tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon the Croſs to teach us to be Chriſtians. And if this has been now done by the Ignorant Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; at leaſt, why do not others, that know better Reprove or Correct it? A Private Perſon cannot ſuppoſe himſelf wrong'd, but he muſt preſently clear his Reputation: but when Chriſtianity is injur'd, there's no body appears in its behalf: Will not the World cry ſhame upon ſuch Chriſtians?</p>
